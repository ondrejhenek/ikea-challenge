# IKEA Challenge


## Task 1: IKEA script

[JS script to be injected to every IKEA page](ikea-all-pages-script.js)

Note: The carousel is injected into the top of the homepage as there is the highest potential for those IKEA-irrelevant products to be sold. IKEA already displays relevant products in all the places where it makes sense. (In pictures, on product details, on room pages...) Of course, a product carouse on the homepage might hurt the IKEA brand in the long term but we are going for a short-term conversion metric.


## Task 2: cURL Engagement API

## Task 4: Flow map
